        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          
          <li>HTML is one of the cornerstone programming languages of the modern internet, used to give a web application its structure</li>
            <li>This is accomplished through the use of HTML elements</li>
            <li>Elements nested within other elements are called child elements, the element they are nested within being the parent element</li>
          
          <li>The <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> element of an HTML page contains information (metadata) which helps the browser render the page correctly</li>
            <li>Metadata comes in the form of child elements such as <em>&lt;title&gt;</em>, which sets the name of the website in search engines and in the title bar, or <em>&lt;style&gt;</em>, which defines the CSS styles used by the website</li>
            <li>Elements within the <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> are not visible when a user visits the page</li>
          
          <li>The <em>&lt;body&gt;</em> element of an HTML page contains content which will be shown to a visiting user</li>
            <li>Also contains child elements, such as <em>&lt;h1&gt;</em>, which creates headings, <em>&lt;ul&gt;</em>, which creates bulleted lists, or <em>&lt;li&gt;</em>, which creates items within lists</li>
          
        </ul>
