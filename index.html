        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          
          <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is one of the cornerstone programming languages of the modern internet, used to give a web application its structure</li>
            <li>This is accomplished through the use of HTML elements</li>
            <li>Elements nested within other elements are called child elements, the element they are nested within being the parent element</li>

          <br/>

          <li>The <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> element of an HTML page contains information (metadata) which helps the browser render the page correctly</li>
            <li>Metadata comes in the form of child elements such as <em>&lt;title&gt;</em>, which sets the name of the website in search engines and in the title bar, or <em>&lt;style&gt;</em>, which defines the CSS styles used by the website</li>
            <li>Elements within the <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> are not visible when a user visits the page</li>

          <br/>

          <li>The <em>&lt;body&gt;</em> element of an HTML page contains content which will be shown to a visiting user</li>
            <li>Also contains child elements, such as <em>&lt;h1&gt;</em>, which creates headings, <em>&lt;ul&gt;</em>, which creates bulleted lists, or <em>&lt;li&gt;</em>, which creates items within lists</li>
          
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to give a web application style, such that it can be more organized and more aesthetically pleasing</li>
          <li>A CSS rule is composed of a selector followed one or more declarations</li>
            <li>The selector defines what elements or attributes to which the rule will apply</li>
            <li>A declaration is made up of two components; the CSS property, and the the value of that property to be applied</li>
            <li>For example, &lt;p&gt; {color: red;} will turn all text within &lt;p&gt; elements red</li>
              <li>In this case, "color" is the property, and "red" is the value</li>

          <br/>

          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage with CSS</li>
            <li>In-line CSS styles a single element directly in HTML</li>
              <li>This style attribute will only apply to the specified element</li>
              <li>For example, &lt;span style = "color: #ff0045;"&gt;<span style = "color: #ff0045;">example</span>&lt;span&gt; will turn the text within <span style = "color: #ff0045;">ruby red</span></li>
            <li>Internal CSS styles the entire page via CSS rules written in the <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> element</li>
              <li>Applies style attribues to all HTML elements which fall under the categories you assign</li>
            <li>External CSS styles the entire page, as per Internal CSS, but with the rules contained in an external CSS file</li>
              <li>The most common form of CSS, as it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier</li>
              <li>Connected to the HTML file via a &lt;link&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt;</li>

        <p>The following are some useful Git commands; note that all Git commands must be preceded by "git"</p>

        <ul>

          <li>git status -> shows information regarding the current active repository & branch</li>

          <li>git checkout -b TITLE</li>
            <li>checkout -> used to move from the current working branch to a different branch</li>
            <li>-b -> used to create a new branch</li>
            <li>TITLE -> new branch will have the name TITLE</li>

          <br/>

          <li>git add -A</li>
            <li>add -> stages a new file, i.e. it will be included when committing changes</li>
            <li>-A -> stages all files in their current states</li>

          <br/>

          <li>git commit -m "made a test branch titled TITLE" -> commits all currently staged files, tagged with the message "made a test branch titled TITLE"</li>

          <br/>

          <li>git pull origin main</li>
            <li>pull -> copies a branch's modifications to the local environment</li>
            <li>origin -> indicates source from which you will pull</li>
            <li>main -> the source branch we are currently pulling from</li>

          <br/>

          <li>git push origin TITLE</li>
            <li>push -> sends committed modification to branch indicated by origin</li>
            <li>TITLE -> branch indicated by origin, to which committed changes will be sent</li>
