        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          
          <li><em>HTML</em> (HyperText Markup Language) is one of the cornerstone programming languages of the modern internet, used to give a web application its structure</li>
          <li>This is accomplished through the use of <em>HTML elements</em></li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">Elements nested within other elements are called <em>child elements</em>, the element they are nested within being the <em>parent element</em></li>

          <br/>

          <li>The <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> element of an HTML page contains information (metadata) which helps the browser render the page correctly</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;"><em>Metadata</em> comes in the form of child elements such as <em>&lt;title&gt;</em>, which sets the name of the website in search engines and in the title bar, or <em>&lt;style&gt;</em>, which defines the CSS styles used by the website</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">Elements within the <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> are not visible when a user visits the page</li>
          <li>The <em>&lt;body&gt;</em> element of an HTML page contains content which will be shown to a visiting user</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">Also contains child elements, such as <em>&lt;h1&gt;</em>, which creates headings, <em>&lt;ul&gt;</em>, which creates bulleted lists, or <em>&lt;li&gt;</em>, which creates items within lists</li>

          <br/>

        </ul>

      </section>

      <section class = "card" id = "css-section">

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li><em>CSS</em> (Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language used to give a web application style, such that it can be more organized and aesthetically pleasing</li>
          <li>A <em>CSS rule</em> is composed of a <em>selector</em> followed one or more <em>declarations</em></li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">The selector defines what elements or attributes to which the rule will apply</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">A declaration is made up of two components; the CSS property, and the the value of that property to be applied</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;"> For example, <em>&lt;p&gt; {color: red;}</em> will turn all text within <em>&lt;p&gt;</em> elements red</li>
              <li style = "margin-left: 80px;">In this case, "color" is the property, and "red" is the value</li>

          <br/>

          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage with CSS</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;"><em>In-line CSS</em> styles a single element directly in HTML</li>
              <li style = "margin-left: 80px;">This style attribute will only apply to the specified element</li>
              <li style = "margin-left: 80px;">For example, <em>&lt;span style = "color: #ff0045;"&gt;<span style = "color: #ff0045;">example</span>&lt;span&gt;</em> will turn the text within <span style = "color: #ff0045;">ruby red</span></li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;"><em>Internal CSS</em> styles the entire page via CSS rules written in the <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> element</li>
              <li style = "margin-left: 80px;">Applies style attribues to all HTML elements which fall under the categories you assign</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;"><em>External CSS</em> styles the entire page, as per Internal CSS, but with the rules contained in an external CSS file</li>
              <li style = "margin-left: 80px;">The most common form of CSS, as it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier</li>
              <li style = "margin-left: 80px;">Connected to the HTML file via a <em>&lt;link&gt;</em> element in the <em>&lt;head&gt;</em></li>
           
            <br/>

        </ul>
        
      </section>

      <section class = "card" id = "git-section">

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>

          <li><em>GitHub</em> is the web interface for <em>Git</em>, a version control software which allows multiple people to make separate changes to a program at the same time without overwriting each others' work</li>
          <li>A <em>repository</em> (repo) is a folder on GitHub which contains all the files for your project and their revision history</li>
          <li>A <em>branch</em> is a workspace within a repository where you can make changes to code or other files that won't immediately overwrite the live version</li>
          <li>A <em>Markdown</em> (.md) file is the type of file in which changes are saved and formatted in GitHub</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">Markdown allows for writing and styling text and easy conversion to HTML</li>
          <li><em>Committing</em> is the process of saving a new version of the file you're working on</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">Adding, editing, or deleting a file is a commit and is added as a change to your current branch</li>
          <li>A <em>Pull Request</em> (PR) is when a user working on a repository branch asks for changes from one branch to be merged into another branch</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">Pulls requests are often used to discuss and review changes with others involved in the project</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">When a pull request is approved, the changes are pulled in and merged into a different branch, generally moving on to be deployed to the live version of the project</li>
          <li>An <em>issue</em> is a way to report on new tasks or content fixes</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">Progress is tracked on project board and the issue can be closed once completed / dealt with</li>

        </ul>
        
        <br/>
        <p>The following are some useful Git commands; note that all Git commands must be preceded by "git"</p>
        <br/>

        <ul>

          <li><em>git status</em> -> shows information regarding the current active repository & branch</li>
          <li style = "font-style: italic;">git checkout -b TITLE</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">checkout -> used to move from the current working branch to a different branch</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">-b -> used to create a new branch</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">TITLE -> new branch will have the name TITLE</li>
          <li style = "font-style: italic;">git add -A</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">add -> stages a new file, i.e. it will be included when committing changes</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">-A -> stages all files in their current states</li>
          <li><em>git commit -m "made a test branch titled TITLE"</em> -> commits all currently staged files, tagged with the message "made a test branch titled TITLE"</li>
          <li style = "font-style: italic;">git pull origin main</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">pull -> copies a branch's modifications to the local environment</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">origin -> indicates source from which you will pull</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">main -> the source branch we are currently pulling from</li>
          <li style = "font-style: italic;">git push origin TITLE</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">push -> sends staged files to branch indicated by origin</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">TITLE -> branch indicated by origin, to which committed changes will be sent</li>

      <section class = "card" id = "javascript-section">

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li><em>JavaScript</em> is a programming language that adds interactivity to a website, often in the form of buttons, data entry, dynamic styling, animations, and more</li>
          <li>There are a variety of user-created tools built on top of JavaScript, such as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, or third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality from other websites</li>
          <li>Similar to external CSS, JavaScript files can be linked to an HTML document using the <em>&lt;script&gt;</em> element</li>
        
        </ul>

        <br/>
        <p>The following are some core components of JavaScript and details on how they work / are used</p>
        <br/>

        <ul>
          
          <li><em>Variables</em> are containers which store values, declared with the <em>let</em> or <em>var</em> keyword, followed by a name, and it can then be assigned a value</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">An example of a variable is a <em>string</em>, which can hold a sequence of text</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">JavaScript is a dynamic language, meaning variables are not directly associated with a specific value type, and can be assigned or reassigned values of all variable types</li>
              <li style = "margin-left: 80px;">JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, meaning it will convert mismatched data types where applicable</li>
          <li><em>Operators</em> are symbols which perform a mathematical operation on two values or variables to produce a resulting value, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), or multiplication(*)</li>
          <li><em>Control flow</em> is the order in which a computer executes code</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">In the case of JavaScript, code is executed from top to bottom, but can be interrupted or otherwise altered through conditional statements</li>
          <li><em>Conditionals</em> test whether or not an expression is true, often in the form of an if-else statement</li>
          <li><em>Functions</em> are packages of code / functionality that can be reused</li>
            <li style = "margin-left: 40px;">Some functions are built into the programming language, such as querySelector() or alert(), while others are written by developers</li>
          <li><em>Events</em> are another way to describe activity in the browser, and interactivity requires event handlers, which identify browser activity and run code in response</li>
